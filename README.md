### Problems

1.**Dhaka** is the **lowest  revenue** generating region ( Lowest number of customer and low  revenue per customer value)

2.**Beverage** has very **low sales per product** value in compare to it's number of products( Highest number of products in beverage category)

3.40-55 price range contributes most  both in revenue **(54%)** and sales quantity **(37%)**, but it provides very **low profit%** (especially in snacks)

4.**Low revenue per customer** generates in **online channel**, while profit% is also lower then other 2 channels

5.High number of lost customers **(19.40%)** and at risk customers **(24%)** who have high chance of becoming lost customers





### Recommendation

1.Dhaka has low % of loyal customer (**3%** less then overall) which impact the revenue as loyal customer's sales amount per order is high. **Convert potential loyal customer to loyal customer** by providing special offer  on high purchase amount

2.**Increase the stock of high selling product and decrease the stock of low selling product of beverage**. Introduce discount offer for beverage as discount offer .

3.**Proper pricing strategy (increase price/decrease cost) for high price product (40-55)** as it has lowest profit% although it provides highest revenue(specially for snacks and personal care item)

4.**Provide more discount offer reducing other offer in online channel as in online channel**, discount offer has highest profit%(32%) and highest sales quantity per order value(10)

5.**Introduce some new products of personal care** as though it has low product number, but it has highest profit%(37.3%) and highest sales revenue per product value($2896)

6.**Reconnect with lost and at risk customer** and provide special discount offer for high and mid range price product
